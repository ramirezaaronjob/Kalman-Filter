PROJECT 1
CPE 470
AARON RAMIREZ

I used professor's code to do this project and I implemented my kalman filter based on the formula.
To run the code:

I used Matlab online in my web browser to run the code.
Full Source code can be found in main.m

APPENDIX:

Date file name: EKF_DATA_circle.txt
Data header: 
%time,field.O_x,field.O_y,field.O_t,field.I_t,field.Co_I_t,field.G_x,field.G_y,field.C
o_gps_x,field.Co_gps_y
Where: 
%time is time index
Odometry or Encoder data from Seekur Mobile robot
field.O_x is Odometry data in x direction/coordinate of the robot
field.O_y is Odometry data in y direction/coordinate of the robot
field.O_t is Odometry data of the orientation or heading of the robot
(For the covariance of the Odometry data you can give a specific number, for 
example: 0.001.)
Data from Microstrain IMU attached on the robot
field.I_t is IMU data of the orientation or heading of the robot
field.Co_I_t  is the IMU data of the Covariance of the orientation of the robot
Novatel DGPS  data attached on the robot
field.G_x is GPS data in x direction/coordinate of the robot
field.G_y is GPS data in y direction/coordinate of the robot
field.Co_gps_x is GPS data of the Covariance in x direction of the robot
field.Co_gps_y is GPS data of the Covariance in y direction of the robot
